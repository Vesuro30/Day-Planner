This script runs behind an HTML page to display the users daily tasks
Upon load or refresh the hour blocks will change color dependant on whether
the tasks are in the past, present or future.
The user will input tasks in the task field and will then be able to save
the tasks to local storage.
Upon load or refresh the script will read local storage and install the
users tasks in the designated hour block.

To use the app you simply click on one of the task fields, enter your task information and click one of the save "buttons". All save buttons have the same functionality as all that needs to happen is the information is committed to local storage. A message is displayed when you click the save button to confirm that your information has been saved.
